Dynamically manipulating colloidal structures via tunable kT-scale attraction can provide the opportunity to create particle-based nano- and microstructured materials that are reconfigurable. Here, we report a novel tactic to obtain reconfigurable, multi-scale, periodic colloidal assemblies by combining thermoresponsive depletant particles and patterned topographical features that, together, reversibly mediate local kT-scale depletion interactions. This method is demonstrated in optical microscopy experiments to produce colloidal microstructures that reconfigure between well-defined ordered structures and disordered fluid states as a function of temperature and pattern feature depth. These results are well described by Monte Carlo simulations using theoretical depletion potentials that include patterned excluded volume. Ultimately, the approach reported here can be extended to control the size, shape, orientation, and microstructure of colloidal assemblies on multiple lengths scales and on arbitrary pre-defined pattern templates.\n  ","date":1559577949,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559577949,"objectID":"7fb3dc5ae5b70dd20f050dba837f9fbf","permalink":"/project/geometrybasedassembly/","publishdate":"2019-06-03T12:05:49-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/geometrybasedassembly/","section":"project","summary":"A novel geometry based method to control colloidal assembly structures.","tags":["chemical physics","math modeling","geometry","applied math"],"title":"Geometry-based Colloidal Particle Assembly","type":"project"},{"authors":["Yan Liu","Yuguang Yang","Bo Li","Xi-qiao Feng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"bd949bdfe045d29d8327dac6c0e6bde3","permalink":"/publication/online-2019/","publishdate":"2019-05-27T03:44:23.181578Z","relpermalink":"/publication/online-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Collective oscillation in dense suspension of self-propelled chiral rods","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1530144000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530144000,"objectID":"299a077dcf7d88d57edc9080508f2dd4","permalink":"/bio/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/bio/","section":"","summary":"Here we describe how to add a page to your site.","tags":null,"title":"About Me","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1530144000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530144000,"objectID":"3ef1c3ed755398dc4fffccfec12a9a68","permalink":"/misc/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/misc/","section":"","summary":"Here we describe how to add a page to your site.","tags":null,"title":"About Me","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Foundation of Mathematical Finance   Download the whole book\nI Mathematical Foundations  Theory of Probability Theory of Statistical Distribution Statistical Estimation Theory Hypothesis Testing Stochastic Process Wiener Process and Stochastic Calculus Jump-Diffusion Process Fokker-Planck Equation  II Portfolio Theory and Asset Pricing  Portfolio Optimization \u0026amp;

Here we develop a model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm that can train colloidal robots to learn effective navigation strategies in unknown environments with random obstacles. We employed a deep neural network archecture that enables the robot to mimic animal navigation decision-making by directly processing raw sensor input and decomposing long-range navigations to short-range ones. We show that trained robot agents learn to make navigation decisions regarding both obstacle avoidance and travel time minimization, based solely on local sensory inputs without prior knowledge of the global environment. Such agents with biologically inspired mechanisms can acquire competitive navigation capabilities in large-scale, complex environments containing obstacles of diverse shapes, sizes, and configurations.

Three-dimensional equilibrium positions and orientations of prolate ( r x = r y textless r z ), oblate ( r x = r z textgreater r y ), and scalene ( r x ≠ r y ≠ r z ) ellipsoids are reported vs. field frequency and amplitude, which are determined from energy landscape minima. For ellipsoids within non-uniform electric fields between co-planar parallel electrodes, the number of configurations of position and orientation is 6 for prolate, 5 for oblate, and 9 for scalene ellipsoids. In addition, for coplanar electrodes, conditions are identified when particles can be treated using a quasi-2D analysis in the plane of their most probable elevation near an underlying surface. The reported expressions are valid for time-averaged interactions of ellipsoid particles in arbitrary AC electric field configurations, such that our results are applicable to electromagnetic tweezers interacting with particles having an appropriate material property contrast with the medium in the frequency range of interest.

Fitting statistical models to such data, to enable parameter estimation and time-series prediction, is an important computational primitive. Existing methods, however, are unable to cope with the high-dimensional nature of these data, due to both computational and statistical reasons. We mitigate both kinds of issues by proposing an M-estimator for Reduced-rank System IDentification (MR. SID). A combination of low-rank approximations, ℓ1 and ℓ2 penalties, and some numerical linear algebra tricks, yields an estimator that is computationally efficient and numerically stable. Simulations and real data examples demonstrate the usefulness of this approach in a variety of problems. In particular, we demonstrate that MR. SID can accurately estimate spatial filters, connectivity graphs, and time-courses from native resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging data. MR. SID therefore enables big time-series data to be analyzed using standard methods, readying the field for further generalizations including nonlinear and non-Gaussian state-space models.","tags":["High dimension","Image processing","Parameter estimation","State-space model","Time series analysis"],"title":"An M-estimator for reduced-rank system identification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qingshuo Meng","Jia Meng","Wei Ran","Jinghan Su","Yuguang Yang","Pengcheng Zhang","Yaping Li"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"6d02fc6081f37acb030d6a1765e2797e","permalink":"/publication/meng-2017/","publishdate":"2019-05-27T03:44:23.180051Z","relpermalink":"/publication/meng-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"We report chemical antagonism between photodynamic agents and chemotherapeutics and provide a solution to turn antagonism into synergism.

The basic model used throughout the study is a high-fidelity representation of a real experimental system in which 32 colloidal silica particles are suspended in aqueous solution with polymer hydrogel providing a temperature-tunable attractive force between the particles. Diffusion mapping is used to determine a set of coarse variables that provide an appropriate low-dimensional representation of this system at four discrete values of the attraction strength. In this case the diffusion mapping process identified two dimensions; one correlates well with the radius of gyration of the entire set of particles and the other correlates well with the average distance between distinct clusters of particles. Two different stochastic models are then built in the two-dimensional (2D) space of these variables, using data from a large number of short Brownian dynamics simulations of the full 32-particle system. The first 2D model is based on a Smoluchowski framework and is used to characterize the overall equilibrium and diffusive properties of the system. The second 2D model is based on a transition rate matrix and is used for process control. A control policy based on an infinite-horizon Markov decision process is developed using the four different attraction strengths as the input variables. The resulting policy is non-trivial; rather than simply selecting the strongest level of attraction, some mix of weak and strong attractions generally provides the optimal approach to the target close-packed state. This study, while focused on the particular mechanism of tunable depletion attraction, suggests a general strategy that could be adapted to different mechanisms of actuating colloidal assembly.","tags":["Colloidal particles","Diffusion map","Markov decision processes","Self-assembly","Smoluchowski equation"],"title":"Controlling assembly of colloidal particles into structured objects: Basic strategy and a case study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuguang Yang","Tara D Edwards","Michael A Bevan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"cde369255cbb0191d77593e862d092fb","permalink":"/publication/yang-2015/","publishdate":"2019-05-27T03:44:23.180768Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yang-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["patterned excluded volume","reconfigurable colloidal assembly","tunable depletion attraction"],"title":"Modeling depletion mediated colloidal assembly on topographical patterns","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tara D Edwards","Yuguang Yang","W Neil Everett","Michael A Bevan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"344605299ca831e3049af423c30c9831","permalink":"/publication/edwards-2015/","publishdate":"2019-05-27T03:44:23.17901Z","relpermalink":"/publication/edwards-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Reconfigurable multi-scale colloidal assembly on excluded volume patterns","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tara D.

However, the dynamics of stochastic grain boundary formation and motion have not been quantified, which limits the ability to control and anneal polycrystallinity in colloidal based materials. Here we use optical microscopy, Brownian Dynamic simulations, and a new dynamic analysis to study grain boundary motion in quasi-2D colloidal bicrystals formed within inhomogeneous AC electric fields. We introduce \"low-dimensional\" models using reaction coordinates for condensation and global order that capture first passage times between critical configurations at each applied voltage. The resulting models reveal that equal sized domains at a maximum misorientation angle show relaxation dominated by friction limited grain boundary diffusion; and in contrast, asymmetrically sized domains with less misorientation display much faster grain boundary migration due to significant thermodynamic driving forces. By quantifying such dynamics vs. compression (voltage), kinetic bottlenecks associated with slow grain boundary relaxation are understood, which can be used to guide the temporal assembly of defect-free single domain colloidal crystals.","tags":null,"title":"Colloidal crystal grain boundary formation and motion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xun Tang","Yuguang Yang","Michael A.

To construct the optimal control policy, we developed a Markov chain model, based on information extracted from a Langevin dynamics simulation model, which originated from a more complicated Brownian dynamics model. An infinite-horizon Markov decision process is defined, and the optimal control policy is solved with dynamic programming using policy iteration. Both the Markov chain Monte Carlo and the Langevin dynamics simulation results demonstrate that the control strategy is able to significantly accelerate the crystallization of a SiO2 colloidal self-assembly process for a grain-boundary-free, highly ordered crystal. Future work will focus on implementation of the control policy on the Brownian dynamics simulation and the experiments. © 2014 American Automatic Control Council.","tags":["Control applications","Markov processes","Optimal control"],"title":"Grain boundary control in colloidal self-assembly with dynamic programming","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lulu Han","Zhengwei Mao","He Wuliyasu","Jindan Wu","Xiao Gong","Yuguang Yang","Changyou Gao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376000,"objectID":"a942d6e73526b72248e420b354f81d01","permalink":"/publication/han-2012/","publishdate":"2019-05-27T03:44:23.179281Z","relpermalink":"/publication/han-2012/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Modulating the Structure and Properties of Poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate)/Poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) Multilayers with Concentrated Salt Solutions","type":"publication"}]
