Here we develop a model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm that can train colloidal robots to learn effective navigation strategies in unknown environments with random obstacles. We employed a deep neural network archecture that enables the robot to mimic animal navigation decision-making by directly processing raw sensor input and decomposing long-range navigations to short-range ones. We show that trained robot agents learn to make navigation decisions regarding both obstacle avoidance and travel time minimization, based solely on local sensory inputs without prior knowledge of the global environment. Such agents with biologically inspired mechanisms can acquire competitive navigation capabilities in large-scale, complex environments containing obstacles of diverse shapes, sizes, and configurations. This study illustrates the potential of artificial intelligence to enable colloidal robots in extensive applications.  \nRead more: * Micro/Nano Motor Navigation and Localization via Deep Reinforcement Learning Y Yang, M Bevan, B Li Advanced Theory and Simulations (2020)[Web][PDF] * Efficient Navigation of Colloidal Robots in an Unknown Environment via Deep Reinforcement Learning\nY Yang, B Li, M Bevan Advanced Intelligent Systems (2019) [Web] [PDF]\nMulti-agent System in 2D  Controlling active colloidal particle swarms could enable useful microscopic functions in emerging applications at the interface of nanotechnology and robotics. Here, we present a computational study of controlling self-propelled colloidal particle propulsion speeds to cooperatively capture and transport cargo particles, which otherwise produce random dispersions. By sensing swarm and cargo coordinates, each particle’s speed is actuated according to a control policy based on multiagent assignment and path planning strategies that navigate stochastic particle trajectories to targets around cargo. Colloidal swarms are shown to dynamically cage cargo at their center via inward radial forces while simultaneously translating via directional forces. Speed, power, and efficiency of swarm tasks display emergent coupled dependences on swarm size and pair interactions and approach asymptotic limits indicating near-optimal performance. This scheme exploits unique interactions and stochastic dynamics in colloidal swarms to capture and transport microscopic cargo in a robust, stable, error-tolerant, and dynamic manner.\n    Read more: * Cargo Capture and Transport via Colloidal Swarms Y Yang, M Bevan Science Advances (2020)[Web][PDF]\nMulti-agent System in 3D  Designing intelligent nano-robots that can autonomously navigate in complex and crowded environments such as tissues and blood vessels can offer tremendous possibilities in biomedical applications. Here we report a hierarchical control scheme that enables a nano-robot to efficiently navigate in a blood environment. Our control scheme consists of a high-level controller setting short-ranged dynamic targets to guide the robot to follow a desired path and a low-level deep reinforcement learning controller (DRL) responsible for navigating towards to these dynamic guiding targets. The DRL controller minimally mimics the visual navigation of intelligent species and maps a coarse 3D sensation of the robot’s local environment to control decisions. From extensive navigation data, the DRL controller is capable of learning competitive, robust, generalizable navigation strategies in free space and in confined environments with red blood cells. Once deployed in blood vessels, the controlled robot can efficiently navigate in blood vessels with different concentrations, vessel size, and RBC configurations. This study identifies the key elements in designing control systems for autonomous nanorobots and illustrates the potential of artificial intelligence for biomedical applications.  \nDistributed Multi-agent System Assembly large number (\u0026gt;1000) of colloidal robots into ordered structures can enable applications not attainable in small colloids systems (\u0026lt;100), yet on the other hand poses challenges of developing robust and efficient coordination and control strategies. Here we report a decentralized and asynchronized control strategy that can enable thousands of colloidal robots to precisely assemble into predefined shapes and perform in-place shape transformations. This is enabled by equipping individual robot with the capability to make decisions on sequential assembly order and navigation through complex environments formed during assembly processes. Using deep reinforcement learning, distributed intelligent robot agents are trained to learn hierarchical navigation strategy across different length scales based on local sensor information at different granularity. Our results demonstrate a flexible and scalable algorithmic framework to control a large number of colloidal robots collective assembly behavior in a robust, error-tolerant, reconfigurable manner.  \nDeep reinforcement learning algorithms Deep reinforcement learning for high dimensional, hierarchical control tasks usually requires the use of complex neural networks as functional approximators, which can lead to inefficiency, instability and even divergence in the training process. Here, we introduce stacked deep Q learning (SDQL), a flexible modularized deep reinforcement learning architecture, that can enable finding of optimal control policy of control tasks consisting of multiple linear stages in a stable and efficient way. SDQL exploits the linear stage structure by approximating the Q function via a collection of deep Q sub-networks stacking along an axis marking the stage-wise progress of the whole task. By back-propagating the learned state values from later stages to earlier stages, all sub-networks co-adapt to maximize the total reward of the whole task, although each sub-network is responsible for learning optimal control policy for its own stage. This modularized architecture offers considerable flexibility in terms of environment and policy modeling, as it allows choices of different state spaces, action spaces, reward structures, and Q networks for each stage, Further, the backward stage-wise training procedure of SDQL can offers additional transparency, stability, and flexibility to the training process, thus facilitating model fine-tuning and hyper-parameter search. We demonstrate that SDQL is capable of learning competitive strategies for problems with characteristics of high-dimensional state space, heterogeneous action space(both discrete and continuous), multiple scales, and sparse and delayed rewards.  \nRead more: * A Deep Reinforcement Learning Architecture for Multi-stage Optimal Control Y Yang Preprint (2019)[Web][PDF]\nApplied optimal control and estimation in stochastic systems Perfectly ordered states are targets in diverse molecular to microscale systems involving, for example, atomic clusters, protein folding, protein crystallization, nanoparticle superlattices, and colloidal crystals. However, there is no obvious approach to control the assembly of perfectly ordered global free energy minimum structures; near-equilibrium assembly is impractically slow, and faster out-of-equilibrium processes generally terminate in defective states. Here, we demonstrate the rapid and robust assembly of perfect crystals by navigating kinetic bottlenecks using closed-loop control of electric field mediated crystallization of colloidal particles. An optimal policy is computed with dynamic programming using a reaction coordinate based dynamic model. By tracking real-time stochastic particle configurations and adjusting applied fields via feedback, the evolution of unassembled particles is guided through polycrystalline states into single domain crystals. This approach to controlling the assembly of a target structure is based on general principles that make it applicable to a broad range of processes from nano- to microscales (where tuning a global thermodynamic variable yields temporal control over thermal sampling of different states via their relative free energies).  \nRead more:\n An M-Estimator for Reduced-Rank High-Dimensional Linear Dynamical System Identification.

By modeling colloidal rods as chains-of-spheres, complete diffusion tensors are computed for colloidal rods in bulk media and near interfaces, including hydrodynamic interactions, translation-rotation coupling, and all diffusion modes in the particle and lab frames. Simulated trajectories based on the chain-of-spheres diffusion tensor are quantified in terms of typical experimental quantities such as mean squared positional and angular displacements as well as autocorrelation functions. Theoretical expressions are reported to predict measured average diffusivities as well as the crossover from short-time anisotropic translational diffusion along the rod’s major axis to isotropic diffusion. Diffusion modes are quantified in terms of closed form empirical fits to model results to aid their use in interpretation and prediction of experiments involving colloidal rod diffusion in interfacial and confined systems.\nBrownian dynamics of colloidal particles on complex curved surfaces has found important applications in diverse physical, chemical, and biological processes. However, most Brownian dynamics simulation algorithms focus on relatively simple curved surfaces that can be analytically parameterized. In this work, we develop an algorithm to enable Brownian dynamics simulation on extremely complex curved surfaces. We approximate complex curved surfaces with triangle mesh surfaces and employ a novel scheme to perform particle simulation on these triangle mesh surfaces. Our algorithm computes forces and velocities of particles in global coordinates but updates their positions in local coordinates, which combines the strengths from both global and local simulation schemes. We benchmark the proposed algorithm with theory and then simulate Brownian dynamics of both single and multiple particles on torus and knot surfaces. The results show that our method captures well diffusion, transport, and crystallization of colloidal particles on complex surfaces with nontrivial topology. This study offers an efficient strategy for elucidating the impact of curvature, geometry, and topology on particle dynamics and microstructure formation in complex environments.\n  Read more:\n* Interfacial Colloidal Rod Dynamics: Coefficients, Simulations, and Analysis\nY Yang, MA Bevan The Journal of chemical physics (2017) [Web] [PDF] * A Simulation Algorithm for Brownian Dynamics on Complex Curved Surfaces\nY Yang, B Li The Journal of chemical physics (2019) [Web] [PDF]\nModeling stochastic physical systems Colloidal rod diffusion near a wall is modeled and simulated based on a constrained Stokesian dynamic model of chains-of-spheres.

Fitting statistical models to such data, to enable parameter estimation and time-series prediction, is an important computational primitive. Existing methods, however, are unable to cope with the high-dimensional nature of these data, due to both computational and statistical reasons. We mitigate both kinds of issues by proposing an M-estimator for Reduced-rank System IDentification (MR. SID). A combination of low-rank approximations, ℓ1 and ℓ2 penalties, and some numerical linear algebra tricks, yields an estimator that is computationally efficient and numerically stable. Simulations and real data examples demonstrate the usefulness of this approach in a variety of problems. In particular, we demonstrate that MR. SID can accurately estimate spatial filters, connectivity graphs, and time-courses from native resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging data. MR. SID therefore enables big time-series data to be analyzed using standard methods, readying the field for further generalizations including nonlinear and non-Gaussian state-space models.","tags":["High dimension","Image processing","Parameter estimation","State-space model","Time series analysis"],"title":"An M-estimator for reduced-rank system identification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qingshuo Meng","Jia Meng","Wei Ran","Jinghan Su","Yuguang Yang","Pengcheng Zhang","Yaping Li"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"6d02fc6081f37acb030d6a1765e2797e","permalink":"/publication/meng-2017/","publishdate":"2019-05-27T03:44:23.180051Z","relpermalink":"/publication/meng-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"We report chemical antagonism between photodynamic agents and chemotherapeutics and provide a solution to turn antagonism into synergism. We report a photochemical reaction-induced antagonism between the photodynamic agent (PS) and anti-cancer drugs during combined therapy. The annihilation of singlet oxygen and alkene-containing drugs into inactive drug hydroperoxides is responsible for the antagonism, and results in decreased efficacy against several cancer cell lines. Experimental and simulation results reveal that the annihilation abates with increasing distance between the PS and drugs via confining the PS and drugs into separated vehicles. As a result, antagonism can be switched to synergism in treating both drug sensitive and resistant cancer cells.

Diffusion mapping is used to infer dimensionality and confirm the use of two order parameters, one for degree of condensation and one for global crystallinity. Free energy and diffusivity landscapes are obtained as the coefficients of a low-dimensional Smoluchowski equation to capture the thermodynamics and kinetics of microstructure evolution. The resulting low-dimensional model quantitatively captures the dynamics of different assembly pathways between fluid, polycrystal, and single crystals states, in agreement with the full N-dimensional data as characterized by first passage time distributions. Numerical solution of the low-dimensional Smoluchowski equation reveals statistical properties of the dynamic evolution of states vs. applied field amplitude and system size. The low-dimensional Smoluchowski equation and associated landscapes calculated here can serve as models for predictive control of electric field mediated assembly of colloidal ensembles into two-dimensional crystalline objects.","tags":null,"title":"Dynamic colloidal assembly pathways via low dimensional models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xun Tang*","Bradley Rupp*","Yuguang Yang*","Tara D Edwards","Martha A Grover","Michael A Bevan","(*equal contribution)"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"5176755408a66178c8579e2b5792d08d","permalink":"/publication/tang-2016/","publishdate":"2019-05-27T03:44:23.182563Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tang-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["colloidal assembly","con fi gurations could","enable metamaterials with exotic","energy landscapes","low dimensional models","markov decision process","microparticle compo-","nents into perfectly ordered","properties that are","ssembling colloidal nano- and","stochastic ensemble control"],"title":"Optimal Feedback Controlled Assembly of Perfect Crystals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael A.

The basic model used throughout the study is a high-fidelity representation of a real experimental system in which 32 colloidal silica particles are suspended in aqueous solution with polymer hydrogel providing a temperature-tunable attractive force between the particles. Diffusion mapping is used to determine a set of coarse variables that provide an appropriate low-dimensional representation of this system at four discrete values of the attraction strength. In this case the diffusion mapping process identified two dimensions; one correlates well with the radius of gyration of the entire set of particles and the other correlates well with the average distance between distinct clusters of particles. Two different stochastic models are then built in the two-dimensional (2D) space of these variables, using data from a large number of short Brownian dynamics simulations of the full 32-particle system. The first 2D model is based on a Smoluchowski framework and is used to characterize the overall equilibrium and diffusive properties of the system. The second 2D model is based on a transition rate matrix and is used for process control. A control policy based on an infinite-horizon Markov decision process is developed using the four different attraction strengths as the input variables. The resulting policy is non-trivial; rather than simply selecting the strongest level of attraction, some mix of weak and strong attractions generally provides the optimal approach to the target close-packed state. This study, while focused on the particular mechanism of tunable depletion attraction, suggests a general strategy that could be adapted to different mechanisms of actuating colloidal assembly.","tags":["Colloidal particles","Diffusion map","Markov decision processes","Self-assembly","Smoluchowski equation"],"title":"Controlling assembly of colloidal particles into structured objects: Basic strategy and a case study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuguang Yang","Tara D Edwards","Michael A Bevan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"cde369255cbb0191d77593e862d092fb","permalink":"/publication/yang-2015/","publishdate":"2019-05-27T03:44:23.180768Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yang-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["patterned excluded volume","reconfigurable colloidal assembly","tunable depletion attraction"],"title":"Modeling depletion mediated colloidal assembly on topographical patterns","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tara D Edwards","Yuguang Yang","W Neil Everett","Michael A Bevan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"344605299ca831e3049af423c30c9831","permalink":"/publication/edwards-2015/","publishdate":"2019-05-27T03:44:23.17901Z","relpermalink":"/publication/edwards-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Reconfigurable multi-scale colloidal assembly on excluded volume patterns","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tara D.

However, the dynamics of stochastic grain boundary formation and motion have not been quantified, which limits the ability to control and anneal polycrystallinity in colloidal based materials. Here we use optical microscopy, Brownian Dynamic simulations, and a new dynamic analysis to study grain boundary motion in quasi-2D colloidal bicrystals formed within inhomogeneous AC electric fields. We introduce \"low-dimensional\" models using reaction coordinates for condensation and global order that capture first passage times between critical configurations at each applied voltage. The resulting models reveal that equal sized domains at a maximum misorientation angle show relaxation dominated by friction limited grain boundary diffusion; and in contrast, asymmetrically sized domains with less misorientation display much faster grain boundary migration due to significant thermodynamic driving forces. By quantifying such dynamics vs. compression (voltage), kinetic bottlenecks associated with slow grain boundary relaxation are understood, which can be used to guide the temporal assembly of defect-free single domain colloidal crystals.","tags":null,"title":"Colloidal crystal grain boundary formation and motion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xun Tang","Yuguang Yang","Michael A.

To construct the optimal control policy, we developed a Markov chain model, based on information extracted from a Langevin dynamics simulation model, which originated from a more complicated Brownian dynamics model. An infinite-horizon Markov decision process is defined, and the optimal control policy is solved with dynamic programming using policy iteration. Both the Markov chain Monte Carlo and the Langevin dynamics simulation results demonstrate that the control strategy is able to significantly accelerate the crystallization of a SiO2 colloidal self-assembly process for a grain-boundary-free, highly ordered crystal.
